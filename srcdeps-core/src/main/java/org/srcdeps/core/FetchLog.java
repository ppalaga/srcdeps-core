/**
 * A facility to ensure that we do not fetch and build the same SCM repo multiple times during a single outer build. If
 * a build of a SCM repo produces multiple artifacts, we want to build them only once pre outer build. This not only
 * saves time but is also especially important with branch srcdeps versions, where fetching twice might lead to two
 * builds out of two different commits. The remote branch might have changed between the two fetch operations.
 * <p>
 * {@link FetchLog} uses an in-memory store and does not require a fetch from a remote SMC repository.
 * {@link BuildMetadataStore} on the other hand requires both persistent storage and a fetch from the remote.
